## BUILD+Run Steps

1. Install gradle
2. .\build.bat
3. .\launch.bat

## Notes:
If you need to regenerate the boilerplate, follow Victor's instructions but load Frc2022RapidReact.dat.  

If you want to recreate the dat from scratch, create foo.dat, then paste all the commands in Frc2022RapidReactFields.cmd into the code generator.
